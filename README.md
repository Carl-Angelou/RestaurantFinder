# RestaurantFinder Mobile App - Final Project
Using Android Studio, this mobile app asks for the maximum distance you want to search for, the price range you want, and particular food types.\

It will use the Google Maps API and your current location to search within the radius of the given maximum distance for restaurants matching your preferences.\

After restaurants are selected, then they will be placed onto a dynamic spinner which will randomly choose a restaurant.\
